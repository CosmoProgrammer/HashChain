#HashChain

Supply chains are usually complicated structures involving many stakeholders,
including many producers, middlemen and sellers. As such, consumers face many
difficulties in tracking the authenticity and journey of their products. It becomes
increasingly difficult to maintain transparency for the customers. `Traditional
systems are slow, prone to errors and susceptible to fraud. It is very difficult to
verify product origins and handling. The customers have almost zero information
about the productâ€™s journey and how it came into their hands, leading to lack of
trust in the product quality and sourcing.
Therefore, this web app tries to solve the above issue by introducing a modern
supply-chain system made using blockchain technology to ensure transparency and
quality.
